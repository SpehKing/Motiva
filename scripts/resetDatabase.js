📝 The database is automatically reset on each app startup for development.

✅ Issues Fixed:
1. Removed require cycle between db/index.ts and db/habitOps.ts
2. Simplified database initialization (removed problematic db_version table)
3. Clean table recreation on each startup
4. Proper scan_method column handling

🔄 To reset the database manually:

For iOS Simulator:
  - Device > Erase All Content and Settings

For Android Emulator:  
  - Extended controls > Settings > Wipe data

For Expo Go:
  - Clear app data or reinstall Expo Go

For Development:
  - The app now automatically drops and recreates tables on startup
  - Use the "Test Database" button in settings to verify functionality

💡 The database will be recreated with the proper schema on next app launch.
